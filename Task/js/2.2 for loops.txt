Exercises: for loops
---------------------
The even/odd reporter
--------------------
Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

Multiplication Tables
---------------------
Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).


The Grade Assigner
--------------------
Write a function named assignGrade that:
takes 1 argument, a number score.
returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.


The Pluralizer
-----------------
Write a function named pluralize that:
takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".
Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and "geese".
